# Smart-Mirror
This is a system that records video when user face is not in front of the mirror and plays the video when face comes in front of the mirror. This gives the user an experience of an eye on the back of the skull. This helps while shaving or applying makeup.

An option to see the magnified face on a part of the mirror is also added. This helps in examining pimples on the face.

Technology/library used : OpenCV, Haarcascade pretrained classifier for face detection
